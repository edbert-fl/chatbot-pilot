# Current State & Maturity

- Existing solutions: Basic Zendesk bot; FAQ pages; manual tagging/routing
- What works: Human agent quality high; good KB coverage for top issues
- Pain points: High volume at peaks; slow routing; manual data entry to CRM/ERP
- Experiments: Small POC with OpenAI for summarization; promising but not integrated
- Desired maturity: Move to production-grade automation with observability and governance
