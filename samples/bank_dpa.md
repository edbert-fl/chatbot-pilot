# Bank Data Processing Addendum (Excerpt)

Processor shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including encryption of personal data, the ability to ensure ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems, and the ability to restore availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of an incident. Processor shall regularly test, assess, and evaluate the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures.

Processor shall ensure that persons authorized to process personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality. Processor shall assist Controller by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the fulfillment of Controller’s obligation to respond to requests for exercising the data subject’s rights. Processor shall assist Controller in ensuring compliance with obligations pursuant to security of processing, breach notification to supervisory authority, communication of a personal data breach to the data subject, data protection impact assessments, and prior consultation.

Processor shall not engage another processor (a “Subprocessor”) without prior specific or general written authorization of Controller. In the case of general written authorization, Processor shall inform Controller of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of Subprocessors, thereby giving Controller the opportunity to object. Where Processor engages a Subprocessor, the same data protection obligations as set out in this Addendum shall be imposed on that Subprocessor by way of a contract, in particular providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in such a manner that the processing will meet the requirements of applicable data protection law.
