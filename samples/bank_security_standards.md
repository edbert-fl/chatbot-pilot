# Bank Security Standards and Controls

The Bank enforces layered security controls to protect customer assets and confidential information. All externally accessible services require TLS 1.2 or higher, and internal services default to mutual TLS where feasible. Data at rest is encrypted using AES-256 with keys managed by a hardware-backed key management system; access to keys is restricted and periodically rotated. Administrative access to production environments requires multi-factor authentication, short-lived credentials, and approvals in an access governance workflow.

Network security employs segregated zones, firewalls, and micro-segmentation to limit lateral movement. Endpoint security includes EDR tooling with behavioral detection, application whitelisting, and automatic isolation procedures. Vulnerability scanning occurs weekly across infrastructure and applications; critical vulnerabilities are remediated within seven days, high severity within thirty days, and medium severity within ninety days. Penetration tests are conducted at least annually and following major changes to critical systems. Findings are tracked to remediation with risk acceptance documented when appropriate.

The Bank maintains a security monitoring program staffed 24Ã—7 with alert triage, threat hunting, and incident response capabilities. Incident response runs through defined phases: prepare, detect and analyze, contain, eradicate, recover, and post-incident review. For incidents impacting customer data, initial containment begins within hours, and notification obligations are assessed with Legal and Compliance. Post-incident reviews are completed within seventy-two hours, with corrective actions tracked to closure.

Third-party risk management evaluates service providers for information security, business continuity, and regulatory compliance. Contracts include data protection addenda and audit rights. Subservice providers must meet equivalent security obligations and notify the Bank of material changes. Security standards are reviewed annually and updated to reflect evolving threats and regulatory guidance.
