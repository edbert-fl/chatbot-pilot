# Conversation Design & UX

- Style: Hybrid (guided menus + free text)
- Rich UI: Cards for product suggestions; forms for returns and RMA; file upload for invoices
- Handoff: Live agent via Zendesk; create tickets with transcript and suggested labels
- Guardrails: Refuse unsupported topics; show top sources inline
- Localization: Separate tone files for EN/ES/DE; glossary for product names
