# Bank Privacy Notice (Customer Information)

This Privacy Notice describes how the Bank collects, uses, and shares personal information. We collect identifiers (e.g., name, government ID numbers, contact details), financial information (e.g., account numbers, transaction histories, balances), and device/network information (e.g., IP addresses, telemetry) when you open accounts, use our services, or interact with our websites and mobile applications. We use this information to provide and improve services, detect and prevent fraud, comply with legal obligations, and communicate with you.

We disclose personal information to service providers who perform functions on our behalf, such as core processing, payment networks, fraud analytics, cloud hosting, and customer support. These third parties are bound by contract to use the data only as instructed, implement appropriate security measures, and delete or return data upon termination. We may also disclose information to credit bureaus, regulators, law enforcement, or other parties as legally required or permitted. We do not sell personal information.

You have choices about how we use your information. You can update your contact details, manage communication preferences, and, where applicable, exercise rights to access, correct, or delete certain data. Requests can be submitted through the secure account portal or by contacting Customer Support. We verify your identity before fulfilling requests and will respond within the timeframes required by applicable law.

We retain personal information only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Notice, including satisfying legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. When information is no longer needed, we will delete or de-identify it consistent with our retention policies. We secure information using administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, including encryption, access controls, and monitoring. If you have questions about this Notice or our privacy practices, please contact us through the channels listed on your account statements or our website.
