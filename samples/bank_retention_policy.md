# Bank Data Retention and Deletion Policy

The Bank maintains records in accordance with regulatory, legal, and operational requirements. Customer account statements, transaction logs, and core banking ledger entries are retained for a minimum of seven years from the end of the relationship, unless longer retention is mandated by law or supervisory guidance. Relationship end is defined as the date when the last open product held by the customer is closed and all outstanding obligations have settled. For mortgage files, retention may extend to ten years to satisfy applicable mortgage servicing and securitization rules.

Electronic communications that constitute business records, including but not limited to customer service emails, secure messages, and chat transcripts, are retained for a minimum of five years. Voice recordings associated with telebanking and trade execution are retained for seven years, consistent with recordkeeping rules in relevant jurisdictions. System logs required for security monitoring and fraud investigation are retained for at least two years and may be placed on legal hold upon initiation of an investigation.

Upon validated customer request, the Bank will accommodate data access and deletion requests to the extent permitted by law. Deletion processing targets completion within thirty days of verification, with reasonable extensions where necessary to ensure accuracy or comply with legal obligations. Deletion is executed in all production systems containing customer-identifiable data; backups and disaster recovery replicas are purged on a rolling basis such that deleted records fall out of rotation within thirty-five days. Cryptographic erasure is used for storage systems that support key rotation; otherwise, logical deletion and subsequent overwrite is performed per media lifecycle procedures.

Where retention requirements conflict with a deletion request, the Bank will document the legal basis for continued processing, restrict further use to the justified purpose, and notify the requester with an explanation of the limitation. Retention schedules are reviewed annually by Records Management in consultation with Legal, Compliance, and Information Security. Controls are subject to internal audit and may be examined by regulators.
