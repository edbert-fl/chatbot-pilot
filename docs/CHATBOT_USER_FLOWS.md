## Common User Flows for Developing a Chatbot (Conversation Trees)

This document outlines high-utility conversation flows your marketing/sales chatbot can follow to qualify prospects, scope projects, and move users toward next steps. Each flow is written as a branching dialog tree with suggested prompts and decision points.

---

### 1) “I want to build a chatbot” (Discovery & Scoping)
1. Bot: Great—what kind of chatbot are you looking for?
   - Customer support deflection / self-serve help
   - Sales assistant / lead qualification
   - Internal helpdesk (IT/HR/Finance)
   - Data extraction / back-office automation
   - Something else (describe)
2. Bot: Who will use it?
   - Customers / Prospects / Partners
   - Employees / Agents / Sales / Ops
3. Bot: Which channels matter most?
   - Website widget, Mobile, WhatsApp/SMS, Slack/Teams, Voice/Telephony
4. Bot: What outcomes are most important?
   - Reduce tickets, increase conversion, speed up approvals, reduce manual work, improve CSAT
5. Bot: What information should the bot use to answer questions?
   - Website, KB/Wiki, PDFs, SharePoint/Google Drive, Databases, CRM/ERP, Other
6. Bot: Any systems to integrate with?
   - CRM (Salesforce/HubSpot), Support (Zendesk/ServiceNow), ERP (SAP/NetSuite/Dynamics), Data (Snowflake), SSO (Okta/Azure AD)
7. Bot: Any compliance or constraints?
   - SOC2/ISO/GDPR, data residency, on-prem/VPC, PII/PHI handling
8. Bot: Timeline and budget ballpark?
   - Target launch date; budget range (optional)
9. Bot: Next step—want a quick demo or to book a 30‑min scoping call?

### 2) “What services do you provide?” (Capabilities → CTA)
1. Bot: We help design, build, deploy, and operate chatbots and AI workflows. Explore an area:
   - Strategy & conversation design
   - Retrieval (RAG) with your documents and data
   - Workflow automation & integrations
   - Multichannel deployment (web, mobile, chat apps, voice)
   - Security, compliance, and governance
   - Analytics, experimentation, and improvement
2. If user selects an area → show 3–6 concrete deliverables, 2–3 case studies, and typical timeline.
3. Bot: Would you like a tailored plan for your use case, or see a live demo?

---

### 3) Data & Knowledge Flow (Sources, Access, Freshness)
1. Bot: Which sources should answers come from?
   - PDFs/Office files, Website/Docs, KB/Wikis (Confluence/Notion/SharePoint), Cloud drives, Databases/Warehouses, SaaS (CRM/Support/ERP)
2. Bot: Are these public, private, or mixed?
   - If private → ask about SSO/roles and permission mapping
3. Bot: How fresh must the data be?
   - Daily batch / Near real-time (5–15 min) / Real-time webhooks
4. Bot: Any sensitive data requiring redaction or special handling?
5. Bot: We’ll propose connectors, sync cadence, and access control. Want that summary by email?

---

### 4) Integrations Flow (Actions & Safeguards)
1. Bot: Which systems should the bot read from or write to?
   - Read: product, inventory, order status, account context
   - Write: tickets/cases, opportunities, tasks, RMAs
2. Bot: Any guardrails required for write actions?
   - Role restrictions, approvals, rate limits, audit logs
3. Bot: Preferred auth method?
   - SSO/OIDC, OAuth 2.0, API keys, service accounts
4. Bot: We’ll include a minimal, auditable integration plan. Book a review?

---

### 5) Pricing & Timeline Flow (Expectation Setting)
1. Bot: When do you want to launch?
2. Bot: Scope size (MVP vs multi-channel, read-only vs read/write)?
3. Bot: Budget range (optional)—helps us tailor options.
4. Bot: Typical pilots launch in 6–10 weeks; production in 12–16 weeks. Want a phased plan?

---

### 6) Pilot → Production Flow (Success Plan)
1. Bot: Pilot goals and KPIs?
   - Deflection rate, FCR, AHT, conversion, hours saved
2. Bot: Pilot scope (channels, sources, integrations) and success thresholds
3. Bot: Acceptance criteria and stakeholder sign-off
4. Bot: Post‑pilot expansion plan and production hardening checklist
5. Bot: Shall I generate a 2‑page pilot plan now?

---

### 7) Security & Compliance Flow (Risk & Assurance)
1. Bot: Any frameworks to align with?
   - SOC2/ISO 27001, HIPAA, GDPR/CCPA, data residency
2. Bot: Deployment preferences?
   - Cloud, VPC, private networking, on‑prem
3. Bot: Data handling policies (PII, retention, redaction)?
4. Bot: We’ll attach security docs and a questionnaire template. Share via email?

---

### 8) Operations & Lifecycle Flow (Ownership & Change)
1. Bot: Who owns content, prompts, and releases?
2. Bot: Environments and cadence (dev/stage/prod; weekly/bi‑weekly)?
3. Bot: Observability and QA needs (logs, feedback loop, A/B tests)?
4. Bot: We’ll propose roles, SLAs, and a change‑management process. Review together?

---

### 9) Human Handoff Flow (Sales/Support)
1. Bot: Would you like to speak with a specialist now or book time?
   - Live chat / Schedule call / Email summary only
2. Bot: Capture contact, timezone, preferred window; confirm calendar invite.

---

### 10) Troubleshooting Flow (If They Already Have a Bot)
1. Bot: What’s not working? (hallucinations, accuracy, slow responses, integration failures)
2. Bot: Where is your data coming from and how often does it update?
3. Bot: Any permission mismatches or redaction needs?
4. Bot: We can run an audit (sources, prompts, evals) and share a remediation plan.

### Microcopy Snippets (Reusable)
- “What would success look like in the next 6–10 weeks?”
- “Which systems should the bot talk to first?”
- “Any compliance or data residency requirements we should respect?”
- “Prefer a quick demo or a 30‑min scoping call?”

### Next Steps (CTAs)
- Generate a tailored scoping summary (PDF/email)
- Schedule a solution walkthrough (calendar link)
- Start a no‑code pilot checklist (guided form)
